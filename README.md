# Staffbase-Fork of AsyncAPI Codegen

This is Staffbase's for of github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen. We are forking
because as of 2025-03-25, team SOM is blocked since there is no progress on
https://github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen/issues/271 and
https://github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen/pull/270. Once those issues are
resolved, we *should* no longer have a purpose for this fork for now.

At Staffbase we know better than to pressure open-source maintainers: To quote
the article 
[Why I quit open source](https://dev.to/sapegin/why-i-quit-open-source-1n2e) 

> Somehow people expect you to solve their issues or implement features they
> need. They’ll complain that the bug you introduced in the last version broke
> their build, or that they need this obscure feature for their current project
> at work, and that if you don’t add it quickly, their boss will go berserk
> because the deadline is already on the nose.
> 
> Folks seem to miss that you’re working on these projects in your free time,
> after a long day at your full-time job, and without any compensation. They
> demand that you work on whatever is, in their opinion, broken or missing, and
> then they get angry when you’re not doing it or not doing it fast enough.
